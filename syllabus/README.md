## Course Description

This course is designed to teach things that will make a Purdue CS student's life easier.

It was created by [Tyler Hoffman](https://github.com/tyhoff) as part of the Purdue Undergrad Student Board (USB).
It continues to be run by USB and is therefore entirely student-led.

You get a point for every lecture or lab

You miss a point for each lecture/lab you don't attend.
