## Contributing Resources to CS190

1. Fork the CSToolsCourse repository found here: https://github.com/Purdue-CSUSB/CSToolsCourse.
2. Write a tutorial or reference sheet being sure to employ good descriptive commit messages. Also be sure to employ markdown syntax. Good cheat sheet on that here: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet. Put your tutorial in an appropriate directory under the `tutorials/` directory.
3. Submit a pull request for your changes.

When you have completed a task, I will review the pull request, make any comments/edits and then merge the changes into the main repository. You may write as many or as few as you like.

Please email me (Levi Starrett) at lpstarre@purdue.edu with any specific questions about the contribution process.
